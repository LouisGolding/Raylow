And a flow of new reporting \\nrequirements from the EU adds to the complexity. \\nAfter having worked more than 25 years in sustainability \\nmanagement, I’ve seen how the field has evolved. \\nI remember when sustainability was seen as just \\n“something on the side.” That has changed tremendously.  \\nI’m inspired when seeing how the CEO and CFO are paying \\nincreasing attention to sustainability and how investors \\nuse sustainability metrics to direct their capital. \\nCathrine Dehli\\nHead of Customer Success & Sustainability\\nPreviously led sustainability at IKEA Norway, Rambøll, \\nNordic Choice Hotels (Strawberry) and Cognite.\\nHello, fellow \\nsustainability \\nchampion! \\nAfter having studied the legal requirements in The \\nCorporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, and having \\nworked with dozens of companies on what it means for \\nthem, one thing is clear:\\nThis directive can either be a huge opportunity for you or \\nmerely a reporting burden.\\nIt can be an opportunity because if you do it right, you’ll \\nbe creating a robust sustainability strategy with buy-in \\nfrom top management. What’s more, you’ll drive progress \\non the indicators which matter, with targets and actions \\nfollowed up on throughout the company. \\nThis is what drives me in my work at Celsia every day.

Before you \\nget into how to comply, can \\nyou first explain what the \\nCSRD is all about?\\nOf course! \\nPage 5\\nIntroduction to the CSRD\\nSimply put, the CSRD is an EU regulation which forces companies to be \\ntransparent with its social and environmental impact. The idea is that if \\ninvestors know more about how sustainably companies act, they will channel \\nmoney to the more sustainable companies.\\nOn top of that, the CSRD forces companies to report their action plans and \\nprogress to become more sustainable! Yes, we’re', \"using an exclamation mark, \\nbecause this is radical development in the world of sustainability reporting.\\nUntil now, it’s been hard for investors, lenders, and journalists to understand \\nwhat impact a particular company has on its workforce, its local environment, \\nthe climate, and more. Companies have largely had freedom to share just what \\nthey want to share, and to cherry-pick the most positive facts.\\nThe CSRD aims to fix this by letting outside parties get the requisite \\ntransparency. \\nBefore getting into the \\ndetails: What is the \\nCSRD all about?\\nWhy does the Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive (CSRD) matter to you?\\nPage 6\\nRegulatory background\\nIt’s true that many large companies \\nhave reported in accordance \\nwith the Non-Financial Reporting \\nDirective (NFRD) which was \\nintroduced in 2014. \\nHowever, you could consider \\nthe NFRD as the EU's test run \\nfor sustainability reporting \\nrequirements. It was limited in both \\nscope and standardization. In scope, \\nit applied mainly to large publicly \\nlisted companies. In standardization, \\nit offered little and left decisions \\nabout what to disclose and how \\nto disclose it to the companies \\nthemselves.\\n01\\n03\\n02\\n04\\nOverall, these were flaws of the NFRD:\\nlack of required auditing\\nThe EU has taken lessons from the NFRD to shape a better regulatory \\nframework with the CSRD. The CSRD now replaces the NFRD. \\nThis means that more companies are required to report, the reporting \\nrequirements are becoming far more standardized, and audits will be required.\\nthe primary users of \\ndisclosed sustainability \\ninformation, such as \\ninvestors, require more \\ninformation than required \\nunder the NFRD\\ntoo few companies were \\nrequired to report\\nwithout standardization, \\ninformation is difficult to find \\nand not easily comparable \\nbetween companies\\nWhy does the Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive (CSRD) matter to you?\\nPage 7\\nTimeline\\nThe CSRD takes effect for large, \\nlisted companies in 2024. That means \\nthese companies should submit a \\nCSRD report for 2024 data. Similarly, \\nthe CSRD takes effect for all large \\ncompanies in 2025.\\nThe challenge is that the CSRD is so comprehensive, \\nthat reporting cannot be done last-minute. The \\ndirective requires hundreds of data points, stakeholder \\ninvolvement, target and accompanying actions, and even \\nprogress tracking. More about that later in this ebook.\\nThis means that companies having to report on 2025 \\ndata should begin preparations in the first half of 2024. \\nThis allows time to define the process, determine what’s \\nrequired for the report, identify data gaps, set up systems \\nto fill those data gaps, and verify the data quality. \\nCSRD takes effect for \\nlarge, listed companies \\n(e.g., 500+ employees)\\nCSRD takes effect for \\nall large companies \\n(e.g. 250+ employees)\\n1st mandatory \\nreport is due\\n1st mandatory \\nreport is due\\nCSRD regulatory timeline\\nCSRD regulatory timeline\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2023\\nAlright, alright. But I have plenty \\nof time before I have to act, right? \\nThe reporting requirements are \\nrolled out gradually?\\nIt depends on your \\ncompany size. There are \\nalso strategic benefits to \\ngetting started early.\\nWhy does the Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive (CSRD) matter to you?\\nPage 8\\nTo be ready for reporting on 2025 data, companies \\nshould begin preparations in the first half of 2024\\nThe best way to prepare for a formal, \\ncompliant report on 2025 data, is to \\nrun a test report on\", '2024 data. That \\nteaches you and the organization \\nwhat is required and exposes what \\nprocesses and data are missing in \\na low-risk way. After all, it’s okay to \\nmake mistakes in a test run. \\nWhy does the Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive (CSRD) matter to you?\\nPage 9\\nGetting started earlier has many benefits:\\nHandle strategic gaps\\nGet an overview of sustainability \\nareas in your company and start \\nclosing gaps to stay competitive.\\nEnsure compliance\\nBe prepared to meet the reporting \\nrequirements when they become \\nmandatory for your company.\\nShow actual results\\nBack your sustainability efforts \\nand communications with actual \\nand comparable results given in \\nnumbers.\\nAnswer to investors\\nMeet investor requirements posed \\nby mandatory reporting on their \\nportfolio companies. \\nWin customers\\nUse your results when answering \\nto increasing requirements towards \\nenvironmentally friendly products \\nand services from customers.\\nReceive financing\\nGet cheaper financing when banks are \\nincreasingly including EU legislation in \\ntheir green loan frameworks.\\nBenefits of starting early\\n“Small and medium-sized businesses \\nshould act now to stay competitive, not \\nleast to meet the coming standards in \\nour role as suppliers to larger, in-scope \\nbusinesses.  New legal requirements \\noften favor bigger companies with \\nmore resources to spend on reporting. \\nIn this case, falling behind will be a \\ncompetitive disadvantage. Investors \\nand customers will use these reports \\nto assess how sustainable companies \\nare and favor those who are able to use \\nstandardized methodologies to verify \\ntheir sustainability claims.” \\n- Trude Ertresvåg, \\nChief Sustainability Officer at Devold\\nWhy does the Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive (CSRD) matter to you?\\nPage 10\\nStrategic implications\\nIn response, we see \\ncompanies adopting a \\nnew tech stack which \\nenables the requisite \\ndata management and \\ngovernance. More on this \\nin section 4 on how to \\nassess software solutions.\\n 1EFRAG’s Cover Letter on the Cost-benefit \\nanalysis of the First Set of draft ESRS (Page 17). \\nNovember 2022.\\nThe EU estimates an annual \\nadditional cost of €320k / company \\nfor average, large listed companies \\nto report in compliance with the \\nCSRD1.\\nOverall, we see that:\\nSustainability reporting will require data and audit trail. \\nAfter all, it must be possible for external auditors to \\nquality assure the reports.\\nMore data and people involved drives a need for \\nefficient governance. Data governance is needed to \\nensure data quality. Process governance is needed \\nfor coordination.\\nSustainability data management will need to be done \\non an ongoing basis, and not as an annual one-off. \\nThis is because companies are held accountable for \\nactions to improve sustainability metrics. The best \\ncompanies will then use metrics related to the CSRD \\nas steering KPIs for their day-to-day business as well.\\n01\\n03\\n02\\nWhy does the Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive (CSRD) matter to you?\\nPage 11\\nWhat is required to comply \\nwith the CSRD?\\nTo comply you need to submit a report in accordance \\nwith EU standards. Those standards are defined in the \\nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).\\n02\\nWait, another acronym? \\nWhat is the ESRS vs. the \\nCSRD?\\nThe Corporate \\nSustainability Reporting \\nDirective (CSRD) defines \\nwho needs to report, \\nwhy they need to report, \\nand when they need to \\nreport. The ESRS reports \\nwhat they need to report \\nand how to do so.\\nPage 12\\nTo submit a complaint CSRD-report you are', \"expected to:\\nIdentify how you affect the environment and external \\nstakeholders, You should also assess how the environment \\naffects the company. Moreover, you should involve both \\ninternal and external stakeholders in these analyses. This is \\ncalled a double materiality assessment.\\nDescribe a concrete plan for how to become more sustainable \\non the topics identified in the double materiality assessment. \\nThis means to define targets, policies, and actions for how to \\nget there. Alternatively, you must disclose that you are not \\ndoing anything to become more sustainable.\\nTrack how you’re progressing towards the targets you set. This \\nmeans tracking metrics over time, and ensuring that actions \\nare followed up by owners in the organization.\\nCSRD compliance\\nThe final report is then a description \\nof your analyses, plans, and progress \\ntracking. You cannot write the report \\nwithout doing the analysis, creating \\nthe plans, or tracking progress. \\nWhat is required to comply with the CSRD?\\nPage 13\\nWe spent 1000+ hours in our team studying the CSRD \\nand how to comply. We’ve worked with medium-\\nsized and large companies to help them through the \\nprocess. \\nIf you’re feeling overwhelmed or confused by what the \\nCSRD is and what it requires, we got you.\\nExactly how do you create a \\nCSRD report?\\n03\\nPage 14\\nA straightforward process for a successful report\\nYou’re already doing this! For more info, you could also \\nwatch our CSRD webinar or dig into the detailed videos \\nfrom the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group's \\n(EFRAG).\\n“No way it takes just 2 hours!” you might be thinking if \\nyou’ve read about what a “double materiality assessment \\nentails.\\nYou’re right that a thorough and complete double \\nmateriality assessment is a longer process.\\nDoing a double materiality assessment means you have \\nto consider:\\n•\\t which topics your company has a material (i.e., \\nnoteworthy) impact on\\n•\\t which topics have or can have a material, financial \\nimpact on your company.\\nFamiliarize yourself with the \\nwhy, how, and what of the CSRD \\nregulation\\nRun an initial double materiality \\nassessment in ~2 hours\\nA thorough assessment needs involvement of your \\ncolleagues and external stakeholders.\\nWe do, however, recommend starting with a quick and \\ndirty version of the double materiality assessment. This \\nhelps you get familiar with what the assessment requires \\nand informs which of your colleagues and external \\nstakeholders to involve for later steps.\\nThis is easy to do in software and/or a template \\nspreadsheet.\\nYour colleagues can help you identify which topics are \\nrelevant for a thorough double materiality assessment. \\nThey will also help with the assessment required for the \\nmaterial topics, including assessing impacts, risks, and \\nopportunities.\\nMap out which internal functions \\nto involve for which parts of your \\ndouble materiality assessment \\nAsk yourself: Whose lives are affected by what we do as \\na company? Which groups represent them? What parts \\nMap out which stakeholders \\nto involve \\nThis isn't just a nice-to-have: The CSRD requires you to \\nreport on how you've involved your stakeholders. \\nHere are our top 3 best-practices:\\n•\\t Tailor your approach for each type of stakeholder. \\nWhile employee surveys might be fitting to involve your \\nemployees, a town hall might be more appropriate for \\nadvocacy groups.\", \"\\n•\\t Set up a way for stakeholders to raise issues \\nanonymously.\\nRaising concerns anonymously is called \\nwhistleblowing, and the CSRD requires that you \\ndisclose whether you have such a procedure or not.\\n•\\t Always, always, always involve your own employees \\nas a stakeholder group.\\nWhile it's not required by law, do it anyway. Your \\nemployees are directly affected by you as an employer.\\nDefine how to involve your internal & \\nexternal stakeholders\\nof the environment are we affecting? You might want to \\ninvolve workers' unions, preservation groups, or others to \\nget a good understanding of your impacts.\\nExactly how do you create a CSRD report?\\nPage 15\\nKickstart your plan for how to involve stakeholders, then \\nmove on  to the next phase of doing a double materiality \\nassessment. \\nA common pitfall is to try to finish stakeholder dialogues \\nbefore starting the double materiality assessment. We \\nthen see companies spin their wheels for ages. Instead, \\nwork iteratively and get feedback along the way.\\nSet up initial dialogues\\nStart by listing out topics in a spreadsheet or in a CSRD \\nsoftware solution. The CSRD provides lists of topics and \\nsub-topics that you can use as a starting point.\\nCreate a list of sustainability issues \\nrelevant for your business\\nAssess the impact of your business \\non each sustainability issue\\nTo understand the impact of all the topics, use the \\ninput gathered from stakeholder dialogues and internal \\nexperts. Impact is about how your company affects \\npeople and the planet. For instance, if the company is \\ncausing air pollution, this could both impact the local \\nenvironment, as well as people in the local community.\\nFor instance, there are several financial risks related to \\nproducing carbon-intensive products. One of them could \\nbe increasing carbon taxes which might lead to increased \\ndirect costs in the future. Others might be risk of losing \\ncustomers as they prefer greener products and less \\naccess to cheap capital because you will not be eligible \\nfor green loans.\\nAssess the risks and opportunities\\nNow that you have a list of impacts, risks and \\nopportunities related to different sustainability matters, \\nyou can assess which of the sustainability matters are \\nmaterial. \\nFor the impact materiality, materiality is decided based \\non which matter has the highest severity and the highest \\nprobability of occurring. \\nThe term 'severity' is defined as a combination of scale \\n(e.g., child labour is so bad it's of large scale), scope (i.e., \\nhow far-reaching is it/hos many people are affected?) \\nand irremediability (i.e., it can't be cured later). \\nWe recommend creating a table where you estimate the \\nfollowing for each sustainability issue:\\n•\\t Scale \\n•\\t Scope\\n•\\t Irremediability\\n•\\t Likelihood (if you're not sure the impact is really \\nhappening)\\nCreate an overview of the \\nsustainability issues that are material\\nBased on your estimates, you can create an overall score \\nper topic. Finally, you combine your human judgment with \\nthe score to decide which issues are material. Remember \\nto pay attention to cases with high scale, even if the \\nlikelihood is low.\\nFor the financial materiality, the assessment is relatively \\nsimilar. Financial materiality is decided based on the \\npotential magnitude of the financial effect\", \"(e.g large \\nincreased costs) and likelihood. \\nPlease note that it is sufficient that a sustainability \\nmatter is only impact material or financially material for it \\nto be required to report on -- it doesn't need to both.\\nThis resulting overview is the output of doing a complete \\ndouble materiality assessment.\\nThe CSRD requires companies to define policies (i.e., \\nbinding guidelines) for the overall approach the company \\ntakes to address the material (i.e., relevant) sustainability \\ntopics (i.e., issues like water consumption, waste, etc.). \\nEach so-called policy should — amongst others — have \\nan objective, a defined scope, a description of who’s \\nresponsible for what, and a description of how the \\ninterests of stakeholders are considered.\\nDevelop policies that should guide the \\nwork on material topic\\nExactly how do you create a CSRD report?\\nPage 16\\nDefine targets with milestones and \\ndeadlines for each material topic\\nThe CSRD requires companies to disclose metrics  related \\nto impact on various sustainability topics and to set \\ndisclose targets (i.e., goals) for improvement. \\nThese targets should be time-bound, outcome oriented \\nand measurable.\\nWhat specifically will your company do to reach each \\ntarget? Here you need to be specific. Each action shall \\nlink to a specific target.\\nWho will do those actions? Improving sustainability \\nacross the company requires help from colleagues across \\nthe organization.\\nDefine actions needed to reach the \\ndefined targets\\nAssign actions to owners\\nDon't get stuck creating your strategic plan. As long \\nas your plan is managed in a tool which minimizes the \\nadministrative burden, you can easily improve the plan \\nas you go along. You can, for example, redefine targets, \\ncreate new actions, or reassign actions to new owners. \\nTo track progress you need track your chosen metrics \\nover time. Companies often have gaps in what they want \\nto track and the data they have today.\\nA data gap analysis helps you figure out which data gaps \\nyou need to fill to track progress towards your defined \\ntargets.\\nMove on and iterate\\nDo a data gap analysis\\nIf you're missing data, then set up a way to get the data. \\nIf the metrics has data quality issues, then address those \\nissues.\\nYou know what happens with KPIs and goals when they're \\nnot followed up... Schedule regular times to report on and \\ndiscuss your company's progress. That's how you hold \\neveryone accountable.\\nAddress data gaps or data \\nquality issues\\nDiscuss progress towards targets\\nWhat's been done and what's still outstanding? Keep \\nan ongoing overview and follow-up with owners about \\nactions that are lagging behind.\\nFollow up on delegated actions\\nIf you've done the above steps in a tool like Celsia's CSRD \\nsoftware, this task is easy: \\n•\\t Review and quality check your work\\n•\\t Click export and get a CSRD-compliant report\\nCombine your work from the \\nprevious steps into a report\\nWhen it's time to submit the final report, you can simply \\nexport your latest plan from your software tool of choice.\\nExactly how do you create a CSRD report?\\nPage 17\\nAs always: Secure \\norganizational support\\nYou know this already, so we won’t spend much time on it \\nhere. \\nThe point is that the CSRD requires that you collect \\na vast\", 'range of data points from many different data \\nsources, so you’ll need help from your colleagues. This \\nis true whether you use software, use consultants, or \\ndo the entire reporting process with your own Excel \\nspreadsheets and file systems.\\nIt’s also an exciting opportunity. \\nThe CSRD pushes sustainability higher on the agenda of \\nthe CEO and the CFO, because investors will now see how \\nyour company acts on sustainability. Because the CSRD \\nmatters to the CFO and CEO, you can get more buy-in and \\nsupport for sustainability initiatives in your company. \\nBesides: If you put together a great CSRD report, you \\nsimultaneously create an excellent sustainability \\nstrategy. That’s because the CSRD forces companies \\nto disclose goals, targets, and actions — exactly the \\ningredients needed in a great strategy.\\nExactly how do you create a CSRD report?\\nPage 18\\nShould you do it all yourself, use \\nconsultants, or use software?\\n04\\nPage 19\\nYour alternatives\\nTo prepare your CSRD report, you have four alternatives:\\nDo everything yourself with the help of \\nyour colleagues, spreadsheets, Word \\ndocuments, and existing tools. \\nGet help from a consultancy to guide \\nyou through the process.\\nGet help from software to navigate the \\nprocess, collect and organize data, get \\noverviews of the reporting process and \\nsustainability goals, and generate the report. \\nUse both software and a consultancy. \\nShould you do it all yourself, use \\nconsultants, or use software?\\nPage 20\\nPicking the right alternative for you\\nBelow is a summary of the pros and cons of these four alternatives.\\nAlternative\\n#1: Do everything yourself\\n#2: Get help from a consultancy (and \\ndon’t use software)\\n#3: Get help from software (and don’t \\nuse a consultancy)\\n#4: Use both software and a consultancy\\nPros\\nReduce external spending\\nBuild in-house expertise\\n•\\t Get handholding through the entire process, \\nincluding internal stakeholder management\\n•\\t Get help running internal processes with \\nconsultant project managers\\n•\\t Ensure compliance\\n•\\t Get guided through the process to finished \\nreport\\n•\\t Ensure compliance\\n•\\t Save consultancy cost\\n•\\t Ensure your data is organized, auditable, \\neasy to track, and can be reused for future \\nreporting – including XBRL (digital tagging)\\n•\\t Simplify internal collaboration\\n•\\t Get all the benefits of software, plus support \\nwith internal project management\\n•\\t Lower one-off cost on consultancy hours, \\nbecause software automates a lot of \\notherwise manual work\\nCons\\n•\\t Very time-consuming way to create the \\nreport and build up expertise\\n•\\t Doesn’t solve the underlying data \\nmanagement challenges for sustainability \\n•\\t Not a long-term solution for internal \\ncollaboration\\n•\\t The total bill is usually larger here than with \\noption #3 or #4\\n•\\t Doesn’t handle your internal stakeholder \\nmanagement (although software providers \\nalso support with dedicated Customer \\nSuccess managers, onboarding, on-demand \\nadvisory sessions, and more)\\n•\\t Requires a subscription\\n•\\t More costly than #3\\nConclusion\\nNot recommended for any business \\nreporting on the CSRD\\nCould be right for corporations if the \\ntotal cost is not an issue and resources \\nare allocated to build and maintain \\ncustom systems, as well as monitoring \\nand implementing regulatory changes \\ncontinuously.\\nRecommended for companies that:\\n1. Want to ensure a compliant report \\n2. Have someone internally who can take lead \\non the reporting \\n3.

For example, \\ntopics could be water consumption, biodiversity loss, waste, working conditions, rights of indigenous communities, \\nand more.\\n“Material”\\nDictionaries typically define this as “significant” or “important,” and it has a similar meaning in the CSRD.\\nThe word is used to say that companies only have to report on “material topics,” i.e. relevant topics, as opposed to \\nall possible topics.\\n“Materiality assessment”\\nThis means to identify which topics your company has a material impact on.\\nThis is a major requirement of the CSRD.\\n“Double materiality assessment”\\nThe word “double” is introduced because the CSRD sets two requirements:\\n1) Companies must assess which topics they as a company have a material impact on\\n2) Companies must assess which topics have a material impact on them as a company\\n“Stakeholders”\\n“Targets”\\n“Actions”\\n“Policies”\\nThis refers to interested parties, both within and outside your company. We mostly use it to refer to parties outside your \\ncompany. Stakeholders could, for example, include environmental groups, workers’ unions, or indigenous groups.\\nThe CSRD requires companies to define metrics for their impact on various sustainability topics and to set targets \\n(i.e., goals) for improvement. Those targets should be time-bound and measurable.\\nThe CSRD requires companies to define actions (i.e., tasks) for how to reach their targets.\\nThe CSRD requires companies to define policies (i.e., binding guidelines) for the overall approach the company \\ntakes to address the material (i.e., relevant) sustainability topics (i.e., issues like water consumption, waste, etc.).\\nEach so-called policy should — amongst others — have an objective, a defined scope, a description of who’s \\nresponsible for what, and a description of how the interests of stakeholders are considered.\\nAppendix\\n']\n",
